# Instadate [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Teamweek/instadate.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Teamweek/instadate)

A minimal high performance date library for Node.js and Browser. Use it to compare and manipulate dates.

## Installation
```
npm install instadate
```

## Usage

### ES6


```javascript
import instadate from 'instadate';

const date1 = new Date();
const date2 = instadate.addDays(date1, 1);

instadate.differenceInDates(date1, date2); // => 1
```

### ES5

```javascript
var instadate = require('instadate');

var date1 = new Date();
var date2 = instadate.addDays(date1, 1);

instadate.differenceInDates(date1, date2); // => 1
```

## Motivation behind Instadate

Current popular date libraries put a lot of effort into doing a lot causing them to lose a lot of performance because of heavy abstractions. Instadate on the other hand only has a handful of features that are all geared towards performance. Instadate is more of a wrapper around the native JavaScript Date than a full on date library.

Use Instadate when you need to run thousands of date manipulations or comparisons per second. Instadate is managed and used by [Teamweek](https://teamweek.com/) team calendar.

**Instadate..**
* is **fast** (10 - 1000 times faster than moment)
* is **small** (just look at the source)
* is **immutable** (Instadate will always return new date objects and never modify the given ones)

## API Reference

**`utc(date)`**

Returns the UTC time in milliseconds.

**`noon(date)`**

Returns a copy of the date with hours set to 12 and minutes, seconds and milliseconds set to 0.

**`differenceInDays(from, to)`**

Returns the difference in days (24 hour periods) between two dates. Returned result can be negative.

**`differenceInHours(from, to)`**

Returns the difference in hours (60 minute periods) between two dates. Returned result can be negative.

**`differenceInMinutes(from, to)`**

Returns the difference in minutes (60 second periods) between two dates. Returned result can be negative.

**`differenceInSeconds(from, to)`**

Returns the difference in seconds (1000 millisecond periods) between two dates. Returned result can be negative.

**`differenceInWeekendDays(from, to)`**

Returns the difference in days (24 hour periods) between two dates. Excludes work days. Returned result can be negative.

**`differenceInWorkDays(from, to)`**

Returns the difference in days (24 hour periods) between two dates. Excludes weekend days. Returned result can be negative.

**`differenceInDates(from, to)`**

Similar to `differenceInDays` however counts all dates that fit into the period, not 24 hour periods.

**`addYears(date, years)`**

Returns a cloned date with years added to it, use negative input for subtraction.

**`addMonths(date, months)`**

**`addDays(date, days)`**

Returns a cloned date with days added to it, use negative input for subtraction.

**`addHours(date, hours)`**

Returns a cloned date with hours added to it, use negative input for subtraction.

**`addMinutes(date, minutes)`**

Returns a cloned date with minutes added to it, use negative input for subtraction.

**`addSeconds(date, seconds)`**

Returns a cloned date with seconds added to it, use negative input for subtraction.

**`addMilliseconds(date, milliseconds)`**

Returns a cloned date with milliseconds added to it, use negative input for subtraction.

**`isSameYear(date1, date2)`**

Returns if the years are equal

**`isSameMonth(date1, date2)`**

Returns if the years and months are equal

**`isSameDay(date1, date2)`**

Returns if the years, months and dates are equal

**`equal(date1, date2)`**

Returns if the dates are equal to millisecond precision

**`min(date1, date2)`**

Returns the earliest date

**`max(date1, date2)`**

**`dates(start, end)`**

Returns all dates within start and end period. Uses `differenceInDates` internally.

**`dateString(date)`**

Returns the date part of a Date as a string. Example: `Mon Jan 25 2016`.

**`isoDateString(date)`**

Returns the date part of an iso Date as a string. Example: `2016-01-25`.

**`firstDateInMonth(date)`**

Returns the first date of the month.

**`lastDateInMonth(date)`**

Returns the last date of the month.

**`isWeekendDay(day)`**

Checks if the given day (0-6) is a weekend day.

**`isWorkDay(day)`**

Checks if the given day (0-6) is a work day.

**`isWeekendDate(date)`**

Checks if the given date is a weekend day.

**`isWorkDate(date)`**

Checks if the given date is a work day.

**`setWeekendDays(daysArray)`**

Sets the given days (array containing integers from 0 to 6) as weekend days. Any day not in the array will be set as a work day. After the weekend days are set all Instadate functions will use the new work and weekend days.

**`daysInPeriod(firstDay, length, daysArray)`**

Counts the days defined in daysArray within the given period.

* firstDay - day to start counting from (0-6)
* length - the total of days to count (can be negative)
* daysArray - array of days to count (if you want to count Mondays and Tuesdays use [1, 2])

**`weekendDaysInPeriod(firstDay, length)`**

Counts weekend days within period.

**`workDaysInPeriod(firstDay, length)`**

Counts work days within period.

**`isAfter(date1, date2)`**
Checks if date1 is after date2.

**`isYearAfter(date1, date2)`**

Checks if date1 year is after date2 year.

**`isMonthAfter(date1, date2)`**

Checks if date1 month is after date2 month.

**`isDayAfter(date1, date2)`**

Checks if date1 date is after date2 date.

**`isBefore(date1, date2)`**

Checks if date1 is before date2.

**`isYearBefore(date1, date2)`**

Checks if date1 year is before date2 year.

**`isMonthBefore(date1, date2)`**

Checks if date1 month is before date2 month.

**`isDayBefore(date1, date2)`**

Checks if date1 date is before date2 date.

**`isYearBetween(date1, date2, date3)`**
